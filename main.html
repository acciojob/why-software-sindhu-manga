	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I want to become a developer because I am passionate about solving problems and creating technology that can improve people's lives. 
		The world of software development allows me to continuously learn and innovate, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. 
		I find joy in building applications from scratch, understanding how systems work, and seeing my ideas come to life in a functional product. 
		Being a developer means I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with creative minds, and stay at the forefront of a rapidly evolving field.
